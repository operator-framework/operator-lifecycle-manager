# This workflow automatically marks issues and pull requests as stale after 90 days of inactivity
# and closes them after an additional 30 days if no further activity occurs.
#
# Key behavior:
# - After 90 days of no activity:
#     - Open issues and pull requests are labeled with "lifecycle/stale"
#     - A comment is posted to notify contributors about the inactivity
#
# - After 30 additional days (i.e., 120 days total):
#     - If still inactive and still labeled "lifecycle/stale", the issue or PR is closed
#     - A closing comment is posted to explain why it was closed
#
# - Activity such as a comment, commit, or label removal during the stale period
#   will remove the "lifecycle/stale" label and reset the clock
#
# - Items with any of the following labels will never be marked stale or closed:
#     - security
#     - planned
#     - priority/critical
#     - lifecycle/frozen
#     - verified
