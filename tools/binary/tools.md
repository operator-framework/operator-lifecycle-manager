# Purpose

The purpose of this file is to enumerate the executable files expected to be downloaded into this directory for use by github actions. Modifying this file will result in a new hash which will in turn result in a new github cache key. When new tools are needed, simply add them to this file. Also, if you need to invalidate the cache without adding new tools, make an inconsequential  change to this file.

- ocv4.5.0
