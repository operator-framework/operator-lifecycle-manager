ALM is a project that creates an opinionated framework for managing the overall lifecycle of applications in Kubernetes.

This enables Tectonic users to do the following in a Kubernetes-native way:

* leverage a catalog for discovery and installation of applications across their namespaces
* automatically upgrade between compatible versions of applications and their operators
* relate application resources together using well defined inputs and outputs

## Getting Started

* Follow the [installation guide]
* Read the [original design proposal]
* Checkout some mocks for the [Tectonic Console integration]
* Review the developing YAML resources for the [ALM itself]
* Review some YAML resources for [sample operators] using ALM
