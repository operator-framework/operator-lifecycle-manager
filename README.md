ALM is a project that creates an opinionated framework for managing applications in Kubernetes.

This project enables users to do the following:

* Define applications as a single Kubernetes resource that encapsulates requirements and dashboarding metadata
* Install applications automatically with dependency resolution or manually with nothing but `kubectl`
* Upgrade applications automatically with different approval policies

This project does not:

* Replace [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm)
* Turn Kubernetes into a [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)

## Getting Started

* Learn the ALM project [architecture]
* Follow the [installation guide]
* Understand the YAML resources for the [ALM itself]
* Review the YAML resources for the [existing applications] leveraging the ALM framework
* Learn to [debug] services running with ALM
