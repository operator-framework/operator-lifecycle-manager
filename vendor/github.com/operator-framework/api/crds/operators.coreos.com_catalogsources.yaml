                        run in PSA `baseline` or `privileged` namespaces. Currently if the SecurityContextConfig is unspecified, the default
                        value of `legacy` is used. Specifying a value other than `legacy` or `restricted` result in a validation error.
                        When using older catalog images, which could not be run in `restricted` mode, the SecurityContextConfig should be

                    Secrets represent set of secrets that can be used to access the contents of the catalog.
                    It is best to keep this list small, since each will need to be tried for every catalog entry.

                            Interval is used to determine the time interval between checks of the latest catalog source version.
                            The catalog operator polls to see if a new version of the catalog source is available.
                            If available, the latest image is pulled and gRPC traffic is directed to the latest catalog source.

                      This struct is intended for direct use as an array at the field path .status.conditions.  For example,

                          useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
