### Usage

#### Testing

This project uses the built-in testing support for golang.

Envtest is also used and needs to be set up. Follow [controller-runtime instructions] and set `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS` environment variable to point to the installation directory, for instance: `/usr/local/kubebuilder/bin`.

To run the tests for all go packages outside of the vendor directory, run:
```sh
$ make test
```

To run the e2e tests locally:

```sh
$ make e2e-local
```

**NOTE:** If you want to run the e2e tests, you need to make sure Kind is deployed in the local environment and switch the kubeconfig to an existing Kind cluster.

To run a specific e2e test locally:

```sh
$ make e2e-local TEST=TestCreateInstallPlanManualApproval
```

#### Building

Ensure your version of go is up to date; check that you're running the same version as in go.mod with the
commands:
```sh
$ head go.mod
$ go version
```

To build the go binary, run:
```sh
$ make build
```

#### Packaging

ALM is packaged as a set of manifests for a tectonic-x-operator specialization (tectonic-alm-operator).

A new version can be generated from the helm chart by:

 1. Modifying the `deploy/tectonic-alm-operator/values.yaml` file for the release to include new SHAs of the container images. 
 1. Running the `package` make command, which takes a single variable (`ver`)
 
For example:

```
make ver=0.3.0 package
``` 

Will generate a new set of manifests from the helm chart in `deploy/chart` combined with the `values.yaml` file in `deploy/tectonic-alm-operator`, and output the rendered templates to `deploy/tectonic-alm-operator/manifests/0.3.0`.

See the documentation in `deploy/tectonic-alm-operator` for how to take the new manifests and package them as a new version of `tectonic-alm-operator`.
 
### Dependency Management

#### Using make
These commands are handled for you via the Makefile. To install the project
dependencies, run:

```sh
$ make vendor
```

To update dependencies, run:

```sh
$ make vendor-update
# verify changes
$ make test
$ make e2e-local-docker
```

The Makefile recipes for testing and builds ensure the project's dependencies
are properly installed and vendored before running.
