# Apply labels as needed. ART build automation fills in others required for
# shipping, including component NVR (name-version-release) and image name. OSBS
# applies others at build time. So most required labels need not be in the source.

# io.k8s.display-name is required and is displayed in certain places in the
# console (someone correct this if that's no longer the case)
#
# io.k8s.description is equivalent to "description" and should be defined per
# image; otherwise the parent image's description is inherited which is
# confusing at best when examining images.
